Growing Pepper

next todo: add enemy dummy to hit, add hitbox to slashing

bug: when charge left/right is held and released after hit, it does not start the inputs

opening scene: crafting your tools - "just like they taught me in school!"

remake assets x2 size for more detail

next todo: immobilize player while talking, make quests functional, create an npc and first quest, change player system to check for input -> if dialogue/options are active then do this

replace text with symbols

let player hold items in hotbar

add layer ordering to player sprite

show tile where mouse is hovering

what prefabs to make
plants - can be targeted by harvest, grows per day cycle if watered
forageable - can be targeted by harvest, does not grow, it replenishes after x days
thing - has ai movement and behavior, can be damaged, can damage player, drops something. ex: tree does not move or attack, can be damaged, drops wood. "things the player can physically interact with"

tree to chop for loot/thing prefab
arrow keys 

using items
item that is not a tool or weapon: down to put down
useable/food: up to eat
tools and weapons:
hold down: ready/charge
while holding down: release down = check if has action (if no, drop item) if yes check if combat_effect_id exists (if no, use small (no input)) if yes , press left = skill1 inputs, press right = skill2 inputs, press up = cancel
while skill inputs: wait until player releases down, then pew pew pew the inputs in order. has individual "resistance to interruption" value where a certain amount of damage can be blocked. melee weapons and tools unleash right away. magic stores the charge (unleashed with left/right press).
UI: permanently shows left right up down like splatoon dpad, with the instructions changing depending on status. "not ready" "use spell" "charge" "pick up"
left charge water:
x x -
x o -
right charge water:
- x x 
- o x 
charge water:
- x -
- o -

obstacle course festival

add scroll function to hotbar
drop items by holding and pressing down or putting it outside of ui

use arrow keys to move

if player is rummaging in a chest for a long time, pepper says "wow i have so much stuff, it's great!" (time does not pause in chests)

make closest tiles only in front (right now it can go behind)

document csp database dialogue system

save player facing direction and start off as the idle[direction]

separate dialogue and quests. quests use dialogue but dialogue does not include quests

dialogue system - decide if it should be concurrent or sequential for dialogue text and npc/player movement/cutscenes
talk to npc: no quest, 1 available quest, 2 available quests, 1 in progress quest, 1 in progress and 1 available quest, completed quests
dialogue db has id, textbox style (one will be a quest accept/decline), text, default next dialogue id, special next dialogue id (triggered by npc from player behavior), quest requirements id 
quest requirements has id, type (collect, do, talk, go), target id (person, item, enemy), optional number of targets, optional next additional id, quest turn in target id

requirements to unlock next quest/dialogue: dialogue/quest progress. does it know if a quest has been completed? yes

cutscenes/dialogue options
*scene unique name
*step id
*speak id (links to different database); text, name, icon
moving character from current position to another
teleporting character to position
character animation
camera effect; move camera, teleport camera, camera shake, camera preset
load new scene; player spawn location
next step id

player specific data: npc available quest, queued dialogue

how are quests set up? area checking, 
quest: target has available quest -> player receives quest -> player completes task(s) -> quest is turned in
npc has quest - available/in progress/completed
npc has 
npc tracks quest progress and tells player about it
npc saves/loads data on player quest progress
npc instances quest location/loot/directions/triggers next steps
player receives quest signals
player interacts with npc/instanced objects

player specific data: accepted quests, completed quests

what should starting place be
home base
todo: change focus indicator to be a space bar below the player and add a glow around the object (attach to object), then fix bugs where the focus indicator does not vanish when player harvests 

what can something drop? multiple things with their own quality, quantity, drop chance

todo: implement planting seed, seed growth, harvest only when plant is ready to be harvested, change database to reflect seed growth stages
ideas: each plant has (seed, sprout, small, medium, large, ready).png, divided equally between variable growth time

when mouse is over a [menu], it can't move player
menu priority: save > dialogue > inventory

class:
database query base class for player

ui work:
inventory
quickbar
options when equipping something (wasd)
indication when interaction is available

plant (lose seed, put seed in ground)
interact (water/advance growth)
harvest (pick, ddr)

click/drag to move
wasd or arrow keys for actions (down = use equipped down; watering/planting)
spacebar to interact with environment
12345 quickbar to switch equip. if slot is empty, empty hand

put stuff into quickbar

database work:
item has id, display name, inventory icon, game image, recovery value
item types? 
inventory has slots that store item id, then the id fetches the icon and stuff
when loading, pull inventory save file and load into game; do not save to database until game is saving
start adding items to the list

bug fixes:
player collision with map

make my own scrollbar..?
pin squares on a background and slide the bg up or down when selecting squares outside of a "visible" area
